## 📋 Project Overview

The goal is to identify and define the core backend functionalities, technical requirements, and non-functional requirements for an Airbnb-style rental marketplace. This will serve as a blueprint for developing a backend system that supports key features such as user management, property management, bookings, payments, and more.
